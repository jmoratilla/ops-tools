## ops-tools

## Description

This repo is an aggregation of tools and scripts I have created while working
 as system administrator, cloud engineer, SRE, whatsoever.

Each subdirectory is a different tool, so there are different instructions for
 building and executing them.

There is a good idea in my head to unify all these tools in one CLI toolbelt app.
  This way it could be easier for managing and extending it.
