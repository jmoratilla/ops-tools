## Cloudflare scripts

These scripts were made to ease some actions and include them in crontabs or other tools.
They use the API and need that the following environment variables are set:

    ```bash
    export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT=<<ask your administrator>>
    export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=<<ask your administrator>>
    ```
